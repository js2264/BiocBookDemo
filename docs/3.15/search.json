    "text": "2.1 Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery\n\n2.1.1 From local to Github\nWhen pushing a {BiocBook}-based package from a local devel branch to Github, (e.g. when writing new articles), two jobs are automatically triggered from a single Github Actions workflow:\n\nFirst, a Docker image will be created to build the {BiocBook} package against the Bioconductor devel branch and push the resulting image to ghcr.io/<github_user>/<package_name>:devel;\nThen, this image will be used to render the BiocBook website and deploy it to https://<github_user>.github.io/<package_name>/devel/\n\n\n\nAdditional commits on the devel branch will trigger regeneration of the devel Docker image and the online book devel version.\n\n\n2.1.2 Package submission to Bioconductor\nSubmission to Biconductor can follow the same reviewing process as other standard packages.\n\nThe author submits a book package to Bioconductor/Contributions;\nOnce review starts, the package gets tested by Bioconductor’s Single Package Builder (SPB);\nThe author pushes changes to its Github repository; this will update the devel Docker image and the online book devel version;\nRegularly, the author bumps versions and push to Bioconductor’s upstream branch to trigger a new SPB test run;\nOnce the SPB returns no error/warnings, the package may be accepted;\nWhen a book package is accepted, it starts being regularly built by the Bioconductor Build System (BBS).\nThe BBS build automatically renders the book and deploys it online.\n\n\nAt all time, the author’s local devel branch should be synchronized with its Github remote origin as well as the Bioconductor upstream remote.\n\nAny commit pushed to the remote Github origin remote will trigger a new Github Actions workflow and regenerate the devel Docker image and the online book served by Github.\nAny commit pushed to the remote Bioconductor upstream remote will result in a new build by the BBS and an update of the Bioconductor’s hosted book.\n\n\n\n2.1.3 New Bioconductor releases\nWhen Bioconductor releases a version X.Y, the core team will automatically create a new upstream:<package_name>@RELEASE_X_Y. This will automatically trigger new builds of the Bioconductor’s hosted book against the new release.\nWhen this occurs, the upstream branch can also be pulled to origin:<package_name>@RELEASE_X_Y to:\n\nCreate a Docker image @ ghcr.io/<github_user>/<package_name>:RELEASE_X_Y, with the book package installed using Bioconductor X.Y;\nPublish the book website to https://<github_user>.github.io/<package_name>/X.Y/, using packages from Bioconductor X.Y.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nA {BiocBook}-based package can follow its own release life cycle if the autor does not intend to submit it to Bioconductor.\nIf the author of a {BiocBook}-based package intends to submit this package/book/website to Bioconductor, the Bioconductor submission and release life cycle:\n\nWhen developing a {BiocBook}-based package (at the submission and during review), the package version should be between 0.99.0 and 1.0.0.\nOnce the submission is accepted and Bioconductor releases a new version X.Y, the {BiocBook}-based package version will automatically be bumped to 1.0.0 in Bioconductor release X.Y and to 1.1.0 in the continuing Bioconductor devel.\n\n\n\n\n2.1.4 Updates\nAfter new releases, updates and/or hot fixes can still made, both on the latest Bioconductor release and on the devel branch. New commits will automatically trigger the regeneration of the Docker image and the online book for the modified branch(es).\n\nAdditional Bioconductor releases will generate new versions of the Docker image and of the online book."

They rely on {rebook} to orchestrate the rendering. Briefly, OSCA books have their book pages in /inst/book/, while the vignettes/ folder contains (1) a Makefile and (2) a dummy stub.Rmd vignette (required to trigger vignette rendering and thus make).\nWhen the BBS triggers OSCA.intro package building, upon vignette rendering, the Makefile triggers the following commands:\n\nwork.dir <- rebook::bookCache('OSCA.intro')\nhandle <- rebook::preCompileBook('../inst/book', work.dir=work.dir, desc='../DESCRIPTION')\nold.dir <- setwd(work.dir)\nbookdown::render_book('index.Rmd')\nsetwd(old.dir)\nrebook::postCompileBook(work.dir=work.dir, final.dir='../inst/doc/book', handle=handle)\n\nThe resulting book, pre-compiled by {rebook} and assembled by {bookdown}, is eventually served by Bioconductor from the /inst/doc/book/ folder.\n{BiocBook}-based packages follow a strategy similar to that of OSCA books: they provide a Makefile in the vignettes/ folder to trigger book rendering when building the package. However, the executed command does not rely on {rebook} and {bookdown}, but on a render command from the quarto software.\n\nquarto render ../inst/\nmv ../inst/docs ../inst/doc/book\n\nThe resulting book, fully compiled by native quarto, is also located in /inst/doc/book/ once the package is built (and in doc/book in the library directory once installed).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis implies that quarto (>= 1.3) has to be installed in the system building the package!"
